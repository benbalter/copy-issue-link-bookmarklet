# Copy issue link bookmarklet

Copies a markdown link to the GitHub issue you're currently viewing in the form of `[issue title](issue URL)`.

## Usage

1. Visit [ben.balter.com/copy-issue-link-bookmarklet/](http://ben.balter.com/copy-issue-link-bookmarklet/)
2. Drag the link to your bookmark bar
3. Click bookmarklet on a page to get the link on your clipboard

## Developing locally

I'd love your help making the script better. The source lives in `src` and the built files live in `dist`. To build locally:

1. Clone down the repo and `cd` into the directory
2. `npm install`
3. Make your changes
4. `script/build`

## Development status

It works for me. It may not work in your browser of choice, and may break at any time if GitHub's markup changes.
